% TODO - The noIndentBlock terminates on a .cls but not on a .tex

% I've (John) tried to comment this file extensively, so read through it to see how to use the
% various options. Remember that in LaTeX, any line starting with a % is NOT executed. Several
% places below, you have a choice of which line to use out of multiple options (eg draft vs final,
% for PDF vs for binding, etc.) When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of the lines you don't
% want.

% I (Ned) found John's comments extremely helpful. You likely will too, and I've tried to similarly
% explain my additions to this template. However converting to the version you have before you was
% quite a change, so some of John's comments may not make sense to you. In that case, you're
% welcome to raise an issue on the GitHub or, better yet, come up with a better explanation and
% make a pull request to help all those that come after you, as I aim to do here.

% NS - Should you need to render for a different paper size (e.g., letter), you can change it here.
% You should also add the "final" option to render your project ready for submission.
\documentclass[a4paper, draft]{oxcsproject}

% %%%% TITLE PAGE INFORMATION Project title

% %%%% USEFUL PACKAGES These are some useful packages that are not critical to using this template,
% but some that you may find helpful to look into. Many are demonstrated in this document, but you
% should look into their other features as you go.

% % Load the glossary terms that you've defined in glossary.tex

% NS - Allows you to use .svg vector images for your figures, as you should aim to do
\usepackage{svg}

\usepackage{siunitx}

% %%%% YOUR PACKAGES This is a good place for you to load and configure any extra packages you're
% using.

% \usepackage{myreallycoolpackage}

% %%%% YOUR OWN PERSONAL MACROS This is a good place to dump your own LaTeX macros as they come up.
